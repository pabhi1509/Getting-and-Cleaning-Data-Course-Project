## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Analysis of file run_analsis.R
->This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.

->The included R script, run_analysis.R, conducts the following:

1.Download the dataset from web if it does not already exist in the working directory.

2.Read both the train and test datasets and merge them into x(measurements), y(activity) and subject, respectively.

3.Load the data(x's) feature, activity info and extract columns named 'mean'(-mean) and 'standard'(-std). Also, modify column names to descriptive. (-mean to Mean, -std to Std, and remove symbols like -, (, ))

4.Extract data by selected columns(from step 3), and merge x, y(activity) and subject data. Also, replace y(activity) column to it's name by refering activity label (loaded step 3).

5.Generate 'Tidy Dataset' that consists of the average (mean) of each variable for each subject and each activity. The result is shown in the file tidy_dataset.txt.
